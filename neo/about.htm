<h1>About the Design</h1>

<p>The new design is simplistic, allowing for the highest degree
of flexibility.  Using cross-browser DHTML code, a page created a
"page in a page" look and feel.  This way, all of the interface is
stored in one HTML file.  New files can be created with the addition
of a single peice of code in the BODY tag.</p>
