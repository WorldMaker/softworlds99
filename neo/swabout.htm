<h1>About</h1>

<p>SoftWorlds.  The name is known to some, and others may soon know it.
Its not a company dedicated to profit or earnings, but to a simple
concept, to help you get <b>your</b> big game or game on the screen.
SoftWorlds will not make games, merely, it act as a "recording label"
for Amatuer computer games, giving resources, guidance, and help where
it can, and proferring benefits, excellent games, and more to the
community itself.  Mark Three of SoftWorlds is the third design the
poor web site has had, each offering unique changes to the whole.
This one, instead of starting complete, will grow organically, slowly
at first.  If all else fails, the old one may be a fall back, or
SoftWorlds will start again, once more, from scratch, like a phoenix,
as a phoenix.</P>
