<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>SoftWorld's tools will expand upon the capabilities already present
in some engines.  Most early tools will probably be SCRAMM modules
and Libraries.</p>

<h2>The "MARKET" Sub-Engine</h2>

<p>There are a few different tasks that I would like the MARKET system
to do.  These will be basically split into three libraries, a general
library, a "CARD" library, and a "DECK" library.</p>

<p>General functions include code to help create simple parallax
"boards", including a possible "tile-based" code.</p>

<p>"CARD" functions include things like providing a simple encryption scheme
through either publicly available tools (GPG?) or a simple home brew
system.  Other functions may be a standard file format for storing
mixtures of certain types of data, graphics, etc...  A lot of this
depends on how much, and how well SCRAMM supports these things.  I have
clear wants, and SCRAMM may or may not cater to them in every way.</p>

<p>"DECK" functions include some manner of database format, and a
possible database server...  Perhaps even making use of current standards
(mySQL?  ODBC?).</p>

<h2>The Quiddity</h2>

<p>Current name for another sub-engine to be built overtop of the
MARKET engine.  To be built with multi-player games in mind, the
system will add to the three MARKET Libs, and add a lib of its own,
a Communications lib.</p>

<p>General functions include things like a graphical, "CONSOLE" overlay,
and worldbuilding interface(s).</p>

<p>"DECK" enhancements will include things like expansion of the database
format to support some form of script language.  Haven't decided on a
scripting language...  It could be some form of pre-compiled LECHUCK,
or perhaps something else like a Java-hybrid or JavaScript/VBScript...
Other DECK enhancements will be a much more useful "Game Server" that
goes beyond just serving out database information.</p>

<p>The Communications Lib will be the most important in the creation
of multiplayer games.  A sub-lib of the DECK lib, all of this may or
may not be included in the MARKET engine.  Though not necessary for
current MARKET developement, the MARKET engine game may be able to
use this lib.  This lib will allow for communications between computers,
be it IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, or other protocals.  Perhaps a protocal will be
necessary for cross-game compatibility.  (I'll explain later... maybe.)</p>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>

<p>I have plans for a library for a unique purpouse that may interest
some, <b>especially those wishing to make a profit</b>, but, however, I would like to keep it to myself for now.</p>
