<h1>Why Join SoftWorlds?</h1>

<p>Many feel competent to cross the frigid currents of gaming alone.
I would like to lend a helping oar to those who do not have such
courage.  Being a writer, with a few game ideas, I felt that I needed
a larger help, with artists and musicians, to help me get my ideas
into physical form.  The larger company at the time was named UFE,
a company that floundered, partly due to the death of the engine they
were pushing vigorously (BOT).  I was stuck on my own, I figured no
one would accept this pile of ideas left in the flotsam of the tides
of UFE's death.  I decided then that I would try to make SoftWorlds
a "known" name, and keep others from having to build from scratch,
and their unique ideas from dying.  We would like to preserve, and
nurture great ideas, and hope they grow up to be <b>great</b> games.
</P>

<h2>What about Profit?</h2>

<p>If you don't want to make a profit, I won't force you.  If you do,
I'll help you make as much as you can.  I'm not in this to make money.
Sure, I would love some extra cash, but I have other ways of getting
it than by leeching all of your cash.  All I want is enough to compensate
me for my time, my effort, my help, my knowledge, etc...  I'm in this
to make great games, aren't you?</p>

<h2>What things do you offer?</h2>

<p>I did have a benefits page, but I felt it seemed to inflexible.
Here's the deal, I am willing to everything in my power to help your
program go from being an idea to full reality.  Whether through
suggesting an engine, to giving access to accumulated libraries and
sub-engines.  Everything put together by my own satellite-company Yggdrasil and
I hope by other satellites will be at your fingertips.  I hope to
offer unique community building tools and marketing tools.  I have many
ideas for unique things that I would love to spill, but you will just
have to trust me.  I will help with web sites.  I hope to host web
sites eventually when I have my own domain and server.  Truthfully,
<b>I have plans!</b>  Just wait and see...</p>

<h2>What do I have to do to work with SoftWorlds?  To be an Affiliate?
A Satellite?</h2>

<p>I require a few small things...</P>

<p>First, I would like all satellites/affiliates and their members to be willing to share
with others.  In the spirit of Amatuer Gaming, I would like to see
everyone sharing what they can.  After all, the SCRAMM Project is willing
to share SCRAMM and I'm willing to share my own resources.</p>

<p>Second, I would like to ask that recognition be given for work SoftWorlds,
or one of its members, or Satellites is down.  Placing our logo(s) will be
voluntary, but appreciated.</p>

<p>Third, I would like for people to see the SoftWorlds logo or a mention
of SoftWorlds and think something like, "SoftWorlds games may not always
be the best, but at least they are well put together and have quality".  In order
to acheive this, I expect quality...  not necessarily of art or sound, put of
concept, plot and creation using whatever materials are handy.  Is that so
much to ask?</p>
