		<P>The Quiddity is actually the Engine idea behind the
game, or games if all goes well.  The Engine will be a SCRAMM-based
LECHUCK Library with most likely a couple of specially built plug-ins.
It will be the first Massive MultiPlayer ADVENTURE Game Engine.  The
first game created will be <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> an experiment to see if the engine
can be built and worked with.  If the game works we have an even larger,
more ambitious game projected, <a href="../azeroth/index.html">Azeroth: Legacy</a>.  After its completion <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> will be dissolved
into <a href="../azeroth/index.html">Azeroth: Legacy</a>.  As with such a project, hints and clues to <a href="../azeroth/index.html">Azeroth: Legacy</a>
will be woven into the plot, and readers of <a href="http://members.xoom.com/WrldMakr/dragon/">DRAGON</a>
will have even more hints as to the nature of <a href="../azeroth/index.html">Azeroth: Legacy</a>.  After the
launch of <a href="../azeroth/index.html">Azeroth: Legacy</a> The Quiddity itself will be released into
the public domain.  Some <a href="../home.htm">SoftWorld</a>'s Distributed Project Teams interested in playing with the engine
after the release of <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> may be given the opportunity.  History shall
tell if The Quiddity becomes the essence of many great projects, or just
a triffling point in the history of gaming.
