<P>Here are our frequently asked questions:</P>

		<H2>What is SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>SoftWorlds is a Distribution Company whose job it is
to distribute games in the highly fragile world of Freeware/Shareware games.
We offer to keep the distribution away from the game creation to make
it easier on the game authors.  Game authors get the benefit of having
a known name backing them and players get the knowledge that the game
is a quality product and worth playing.</P>

		<H2>Can I get my game distributed by SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>In short, yes.  In long, we have a few requirements
that you will have to agree to.  Some don't apply if you simply doing one game through us.  Check them out at our <a href="benefits.htm">Benefits and Requirements</a> page.</P>

		<H2>What are the benefits of getting my game distributed by SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>In addition to what has already been mentioned, check out our <a href="benefits.htm">Benefits and Requirements</a> page.</P>

		<H2>How do I get my game distributed by SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>E-Mail me for info @ <a href="mailto:world_maker@yahoo.com">world_maker@yahoo.com</a>.</P>

		<H2>Can I get my firm/company/group/project team to be solely distributed through SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>Yes.  See above, and feel free to <a href="mailto:world_maker@yahoo.com">e-mail me</a>.</P>

		<H2>How can I get my firm/company/group/project team's web site designed/hosted by SoftWorlds?</H2>
		
		<P>E-Mail me for more info, I am currently working out the pricing and I am working on getting a better
server at which I will ask for hosting costs.</P>
		
		<H2>What will happen to the games that SoftWorlds was producing (Market$hare/Chronicles)?</H2>

		<P>These will still be distributed under the SoftWorlds label and are being phased out to the
Yggdrasil Games production arm of SoftWorlds...  Our page is under development.</P>

		<H2>May I join Yggdrasil Games?</H2>

		<P>Yes, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:world_maker@yahoo.com">world_maker@yahoo.com</a>.</P>

		<H2>May I join another firm/company/group/project distributing through SoftWorlds?</H2>

		<P>It depends, e-mail the firm/company/group/project's leader and ask him/her.</P>

		<H2>Can I advertise on SoftWorlds pages?</H2>

		<P>Our pages will include blurbs from games we distribute, and we are working
on a banner and button advertising rotation...  Games we distribute will get free ad space on these,
but we will sell space.</P>
