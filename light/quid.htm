<P>The Quiddity is actually the Engine idea behind the
game, or games if all goes well.  The Engine will be a SCRAMM-based
LECHUCK Library with most likely a couple of specially built plug-ins.
It will be the first Massive MultiPlayer ADVENTURE Game Engine.  The
first game created will be <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> an experiment to see if the engine
can be built and worked with.  If the game works we have an even larger,
more ambitious game projected.  After its completion <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> will be dissolved
into the larger game.  As with such a project, hints and clues to the
larger game will be woven into the plot, and readers of <a href="http://members.xoom.com/WrldMakr/dragon/">DRAGON</a>
will have even more hints as to the nature of the larger project.  After the
launch of the larger project The Quiddity itself will be released into
the public domain.  Some SoftWorld's Distributed Project Teams interested in playing with the engine
after the release of <a href="eazer.htm">Eazer</a> may be given the opportunity.  History shall
tell if The Quiddity becomes the essence of many great projects, or just
a triffling point in the history of gaming.
