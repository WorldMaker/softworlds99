<P>Market$hare is the odd card game with a sense of humor.  Face off against up to
three opponents (for a total of four) and try to make a corporate takeover.</P>

		<P>There will be Six Classes of cards, Spaceships, Aliens, Planets, Weapons, Tools, and Scouts/Probes.
There will be a total of 165 cards total.  155 will be used for normal games, and the additional ten are for a special
"Dark Mode" which may or may not be released...</P>

		<P>"Dark Mode" will be only available for Network play, and will hide other players
cards from your view.  Scouts and Probes will reveal information about another player.  The incredible 10th card, is
a card that everyone will want (and could call a heavy price during a game) which will let you see one of your
opponents board and hand for one turn.</P>

		<P>The heart and soul of the game is the MarketPlace, which will let you trade
cards you can't use (a Beta Quadrant card isn't really useful if you are in the Alpha Quadrant).  This
also means that you can get the cards you need as well.  Unlike games like Magic: The Gathering, all
players all are dealt and draw from one deck, so the only way to get cards you really want and luck
isn't your thing is through the MarketPlace.</P>

		<P>Here is a breakdown of what the card classes do:</P>

		<UL>
		<LI><b>The Holding Cards</b>
		<LI>Spaceships -- These can be manned or unmanned, if you place a group of aliens here, you
will receive added power to the spaceships built-in power.  A spaceship is your most powerful weapon against
your enemies, because it is mobile, it can act as a defense to one of your planets, or as your offence.  These
can also be augmented with weapons to even further its powers.
		<LI>Planets -- Are your resources, without any planets, you can't lay any cards, and you can't
guard yourself from attack.  You can place your aliens here to help augment your resources, and even add weapons
to add to your defensive power.
		<LI><b>Augmentors</b>
		<LI>Aliens -- These are your manned forces, by deploying these you augment the powers of your
various planets and spacecraft.
		<LI>Weapons -- These augment the defensive and offensive powers of your planets and spacecraft.
		<LI><b>Others</b>
		<LI>Tools -- Perform a variety of tasks and give you different advantages/disadvantages.
		<LI>Scouts &amp; Probes -- These are only for Dark Play.
