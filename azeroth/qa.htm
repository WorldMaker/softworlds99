		<CODE>
		"Even though he was always very kind (in fact, if
he wasn't so rich and well known he could have been your neighbor or
best friend in high school), he hated meeting the press because they
asked to many questions, and didn't understand the answers."<BR><BR>
- Jutnix Jare, "Bob: Even More of The Man, The Myth and the Unicorns."
		</CODE>

		<H2>What is the game about?</H2>

		<P>The game is about Azeroth, a paradise, a place where unicorns and
dragons and cute, cuddly 6 foot rats were just a few of the wonders and delights to
sample, a place that had been made a resort to the richest aliens, a place where wounds
were healed and true joy was realised.</P>

		<H2>Who is the game about?</H2>

		<P>The game is about Bob, one of the last to escape Azeroth's fate,
he became the richest man in the Tri-Galactic area.</P>

		<H2>Who are Jutnix Jare and First Volus Ortrius?</H2>

		<P>First Volus Ortrius was the founder of the Guild of Catalogs, the
head of tri-galactic research.  The Volus are researchers who stretch through time
and space learning and cataloging the world.</P>

		<P>Jutnix Jare was a reporter for the Galactinet Texbloid, the
Tri-Galactic News Network, he quit after becoming friends with Bob, and he wrote
Bob's life story.  Most of what the Tri-Galactic Area knows about Bob is through
Jutnix.</P>

		<H3>Why do some people have one name and others have two?</H3>

		<P>Actually, everybody has two, but Volis drop there second
ones when they are Apprenticed.  Noboddy knows Bob's second name, but
many have guesses.</P>

		<H2>What is a Texbloid?</H2>

		<P>A Texbloid is a magazine that resides on the Galactinet
and can be read by anyone.</P>

		<H2>What is the Galactinet?</H2>

		<P>The Galactinet is a unique network which binds all
technology at the quantum level.  The problem is not in placing your
information up, but being able to read the data that is already there.
Most people use an Integrator Service Provider (ISP) to read the data,
the Volis use their own server, which has the tri-galaxy's biggest Integrator.</P>

		<H2>What species live in the Tri-Galactic Area?</H2>

<P>Humans and animals mostly, because Azeroth lies in what is called the
human disaster area (hda) which is the section of the tree in which Azeroth
(or its equivalant) is destroyed,  Azeroth is destroyed in the middle of all
the other worlds, and thus forms the middle line or base/trunk line.  On all
the Earths in this sector (which is the only sector easily travellable, and thus,
GPS coordinates refer solely to this sector), the humans manage to
escape their fate, and even manage to gain the high hand in Tri-Galactic
politics.  The Tri-Galactic area refers to the three Galaxies which support
humans in every sector.  There are things outside of the Tri-Galactic area, but
humans don't really care.</P>
		<!--<H2>What does all this have to do with Eazer?</H2>

<P>Eazer is a parallel of Azeroth, it lies in [+/-345].  In the game
Eazer your task is/was to save humanity from the destruction of the planet,
in this one, one of the things that you can learn is the history, the
<b>legacy</b> of Azeroth, why was it destroyed, who destroyed it, who
saved humanity, who saved Bob, and more...</P>-->

		<H2>What are all the Unicorns about?</H2>

<P>From "Janx: The Unicorn behind the Man and the Myth":</P>

<CODE>"Bob was a tavern owner, he owned the LightFoot Inn at the crossroad
of Hedgeny Road and Busher Street.  But, what he really enjoyed, was
his horse, his unicorn, his best friend, Janxs.  He enjoyed riding in
the cool dawn on Janxs, and Janxs enjoyed his company as well."<BR><BR>
- Jutnix Jare</CODE>

		<H2>Is there a comprehensive history I can read to help get
prepared for the game?</H2>

<P>No, this universe has been in my head for many years, and I have worked
out some of the history of it, but any more than what I have revealed will
have to wait until I am ready...</P>

		<H2>How do I effect the story line?</H2>

<P>Because the universe is large, with Azeroth, I am giving you, the
player a chance to make Tri-Galactic history.  {A Legal Document will
be linked here.}  You can influence events, create events, take part
in events, and even have fun doing it.</P>

<P>Not only that, but the game world will be expandable by none other than
you.  You can build planets and a Corporate Empire and let others make use
of your services, and have fun solving and exploring the puzzles and worlds
you create.</P>

		<H2>What is the point to the game?  Where is the ending?</H2>

<P>The point to the game?  It would either be, "There is no point", or
"Enjoy the Now, the rest doesn't matter."  You decide.  As to the ending, you
can also decide, it can end with a dramatic presentation of your characters death,
maybe you are stuck in your mansion yelling for "Parnut Bud!" or you are killed
defending your best friend.  Whatever you want!</P>
