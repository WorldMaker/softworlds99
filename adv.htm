		<P>What are the Advantages of playing a SoftWorlds distributed game?</P>

		<P>Here are some of the advantages:</P>

		<UL>
		<LI>You are assured a quality game.  This doesn't mean
that the game will use all the latest hardware and have full color
animation with hot fmv, this means that the program will be enjoyable
and worth playing.
		<LI>You are given full contact and help information,
as well as bug report addresses and a place to find up to date information
on patches, fixes and more.
		<LI>Stuck?  We will provide complete hint service, ranging
from our <code>tips</code> network (not yet complete) to a dedicated pay-per hint
system (also not yet available).
		<LI>Played all of our best and want more?  Want to develop your
own games?  We will provide the resources you need (engine, sub-engines) to
get started on your own game, and we will offer you the <a href="benefits.htm">benefits</a>
of working through SoftWorlds as your distributor.
		</UL>
