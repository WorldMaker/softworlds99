		<P>SoftWorlds is a part of WorldMaker Online, my web of pages.</P>

		<P>SoftWorlds has been re-engineered to stay alive!  We are no longer a part of UFE (r.i.p)
and we have decided to act as a Distribution Medium in a highly unstable area of work.  Many companies are dead or
dying.  Many lost interest or became bloated.  SoftWorlds will act as an intermediary hosting your game, its site
as well as giving your players the safety of our label.  Many people know our label and as we expand many more
will.  We will also host and distribute whole game companies.  Much like a movie where a film may be
created by a small company like Caravan and distributed by a larger company like Disney/Buena Vista.  We will
act as the large company providing the advertising and the media to your audience, you provide the game.
Of course, I will still make games through SoftWorlds.  For more information on getting your game through
us feel free to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:world_maker@yahoo.com">world_maker@yahoo.com</a>.</P>
